3f Good and clean. Produces the correct result. The one-line statement is a bit long, maybe break it up to multiple lines for readability. Nit: To make your list declaration cleaner, you can write '[item for item in ...]', versus 'list(item for item in...)'

ru Keeping the program to one line makes it a little more difficult to read. Breaking it down to multiple lines will make it much more readable. The output is incorrect. I believe it's because of your 'and len(word) > 2' condition. A word with 1 or 2 letters can still be a palindrome. ex: A or BB; both can be reversed and still be the same. You have unnecessary type conversions. You first create a list, then convert it to a set, then convert it back to a list. You can remove the list(set(...)) and still return the same result

5c Returns incorrect result. I think because it's adding '' as an extra element to c. The code is easy to read, but maybe broken up a little too much. It might make more sense to combine the reverse and palindrome check into one.

gx Clean and easy to read for loop. Produces correct result.

ka Good and clean. Easy to read. Produces correct result

uv Produces correct result. Single line is hard to read. 'ln[::-1].strip('\n')' is an unnecessary reverse and strip operation; you can just count the result

ys Good and clean. Easy to read on a single line. Produces correct result.
